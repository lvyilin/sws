Name: sws -- HTTP/1.0 web server

  sws is a very simple web server. It behaves quite like you would expect from any regular web server, in that it binds to a given port on the given address and waits for incoming HTTP/1.0 requests.It serves content from the given directory. That is, any requests from documents is resolved relative to this directory (the document root).
